# Welcome to MuJoCo world

This repository was created for manipulator control in a mujoco environment.

You can see three robot(`Franka Emilka's panda`, `Kuka's iiwa14`, `Rethink's sawyer`) demos.

As a library to solve kinematics, I used my own [`pykin`](https://github.com/jdj2261/pykin) library.

I referenced it [franka_sim](https://github.com/vikashplus/franka_sim) and [sawyer_sim](https://github.com/vikashplus/sawyer_sim) to create a mujoco environment 
and [robosuite](https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite) to control joint position, velocity, torque.
